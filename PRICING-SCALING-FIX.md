# Pricing Scaling Fix - Webly Industries

## Problem Identified
The pricing plans section was causing horizontal scrolling on desktop because:
- The grid used `grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr)` which forced all 5 cards into a single row
- The container had `max-width: 1600px` which exceeded most desktop viewport widths
- Responsive breakpoints only kicked in at 1200px, leaving a gap for medium-large screens

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Responsive Grid Layout
- **Before**: `grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr)` (fixed 5 columns)
- **After**: `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr))` (responsive auto-fit)

### 2. Container Width Optimization
- **Before**: `max-width: 1600px` (too wide for most screens)
- **After**: `max-width: 1400px` (better fit for desktop screens)

### 3. Card Size Constraints
- Added `min-width: 280px` and `max-width: 320px` to pricing cards
- Reduced padding from `3rem 2rem` to `2.5rem 1.5rem` for better fit
- Added `justify-items: center` for better alignment

### 4. Typography Adjustments
- **Pricing Title**: Reduced from `2.81rem` to `1.8rem`
- **Pricing Price**: Reduced from `3rem` to `2.5rem`

### 5. Responsive Breakpoints
- **1400px and below**: `max-width: 1200px`
- **1200px and below**: `max-width: 1000px`
- **1024px and below**: `max-width: 800px`
- **768px and below**: Single column layout (unchanged)
