# Four Cards Row Fix - Webly Industries

## Problem Solved
The pricing section was displaying 3 cards in the first row and 1 card in the second row, but the requirement was to show all 4 pricing cards in a single horizontal row on desktop.

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ **Grid Layout Changes**
- **Before**: `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr))` (responsive auto-fit)
- **After**: `grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr)` (fixed 4 columns)

### ✅ **Spacing Optimization**
- **Gap**: Reduced from `1.5rem` to `1rem` for tighter spacing
- **Max-width**: Increased from `1200px` to `1400px` to accommodate 4 cards
- **Padding**: Reduced from `2.5rem 1.5rem` to `2rem 1rem` for better space utilization

### ✅ **Card Constraints Removed**
- **Before**: `max-width: 350px; min-width: 300px` (fixed card sizes)
- **After**: `max-width: 100%; min-width: 0` (flexible card sizes)

### ✅ **Responsive Breakpoints Updated**
- **Desktop (1200px+)**: 4 cards in one row
- **Tablet (768px-1024px)**: 2 cards per row  
- **Mobile (768px and below)**: 1 card per row

## Current Layout Behavior

### Desktop Screens (1200px and above)
```
[Consultation] [Starter+Maintenance] [Starter] [Professional]
```
All 4 cards display horizontally in a single row with equal spacing.

### Tablet Screens (768px - 1024px)
```
[Consultation] [Starter+Maintenance]

```
Cards display in a 2x2 grid layout for optimal tablet viewing.

### Mobile Screens (768px and below)
```

Cards stack vertically in a single column for easy mobile scrolling.
