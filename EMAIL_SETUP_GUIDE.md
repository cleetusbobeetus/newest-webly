# Email Setup Guide for Webly Industries

## 🚀 Automatic Email Sending Setup

Your contact form is now configured to automatically send emails to `zanelafaverr@gmail.com` in a professional format!

### Current Status:
✅ **Form formatting** - Complete  
✅ **Email template** - Complete  
✅ **Fallback methods** - Complete  
⚠️ **EmailJS setup** - Needs configuration  

## 📧 How It Currently Works:

### Method 1: EmailJS (Recommended - Fully Automatic)
When someone fills out your contact form, it will automatically send a formatted email to your Gmail.

### Method 2: Mailto Fallback (Currently Active)
If EmailJS isn't set up, it opens your email client with a pre-filled message.

### Method 3: Clipboard Fallback
As a last resort, it copies the formatted message to your clipboard.

## 🔧 To Set Up Fully Automatic Emails:

### Step 1: Create EmailJS Account
1. Go to [emailjs.com](https://emailjs.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Add Email Service
1. In EmailJS dashboard, go to "Email Services"
2. Click "Add New Service"
3. Choose "Gmail"
4. Connect your Gmail account (`zanelafaverr@gmail.com`)
5. Note down your **Service ID**

### Step 3: Create Email Template
1. Go to "Email Templates"
2. Click "Create New Template"
3. Use this template:

**Subject:**
```
{{subject}}
```

**Content:**
```
{{formatted_message}}
```

4. Note down your **Template ID**

### Step 4: Get Public Key
1. Go to "Account" → "General"
2. Copy your **Public Key**

### Step 5: Update Your Website
1. Open `email-service.js`
2. Replace `YOUR_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY` with your actual public key
3. Replace `service_webly_industries` with your service ID
4. Replace `template_contact_form` with your template ID
